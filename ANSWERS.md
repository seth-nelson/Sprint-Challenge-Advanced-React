- [x] Why would you use class component over function components (removing hooks from the question)?
    ```Class components implement logic and state, as well as the lifecycle method```
- [x] Name three lifecycle methods and their purposes.
    ```ComponentDidMount, componentDidUpdate, and componentWillUnmount. Mounting, updating, and unmounting```
- [x] What is the purpose of a custom hook?
    ```Custom hooks have reusable stateful logic```
- [x] Why is it important to test our apps?
    ```To visualize early and potential bugs before the app is released.```
